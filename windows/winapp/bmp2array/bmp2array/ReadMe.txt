    WIN32 APPLICATION : bmp2array Project Overview
========================================================================

AppWizard has created this bmp2array application for you.  

This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that
make up your bmp2array application.


bmp2array.vcproj
    This is the main project file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard. 
    It contains information about the version of Visual C++ that generated the file, and 
    information about the platforms, configurations, and project features selected with the
    Application Wizard.

bmp2array.cpp
    This is the main application source file.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
AppWizard has created the following resources:

bmp2array.rc
    This is a listing of all of the Microsoft Windows resources that the
    program uses.  It includes the icons, bitmaps, and cursors that are stored
    in the RES subdirectory.  This file can be directly edited in Microsoft
    Visual C++.

Resource.h
    This is the standard header file, which defines new resource IDs.
    Microsoft Visual C++ reads and updates this file.

bmp2array.ico
    This is an icon file, which is used as the application's icon (32x32).
    This icon is included by the main resource file bmp2array.rc.

small.ico
    This is an icon file, which contains a smaller version (16x16)
    of the application's icon. This icon is included by the main resource
    file bmp2array.rc.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Other standard files:

StdAfx.h, StdAfx.cpp
    These files are used to build a precompiled header (PCH) file
    named bmp2array.pch and a precompiled types file named StdAfx.obj.
